# my-open-webui: GenAI Workbench
Personal AI Exploration Platform on AWS Deploy a privacy-focused GenAI environment for individual use and rapid experimentation. Includes Open WebUI and essential tools like Portainer, VSCode, LiteLLM, and Jupyter Lab. Perfect for AI enthusiasts seeking a quick, secure personal sandbox.

## Assumptions and pre-requisites
- You are using Windows machine
- You have access to an AWS account
- You are using us-east-1 region

## Design principles
- Keep cost lowest
- KISS - Keep it simple, stupid 
- Scalability and performance are not primary focus. Primary focus is to get things done quickly.
- Security is tight. But only as much required. (Ex: using dummy certs to enable HTTPS)

## What will be installed?
- An EC2 will be created and following softwares will be installed in it:
    - Open WebUI
    - Portainer (Web based Docker management)
    - Code-server (VSCode on EC2 in your browser)
    - LiteLLM (Gateway to Bedrock)
    - Jupyter Lab
    - Caddy (reverse proxy and authetication server)
    - Controller (Custom web based tool to launch other apps and control EC2)

## Why should I use this?
- Enjoy full privacy. All your chats private. Bedrock does not store your chats and does not use it for retraining.
- Best use of your AWS account to learn and experiment GenAI.
- Get a powerful workbench on which you can build further capabilities.

## Tips and tricks

### Careful before changing project_id
- If you have already deployed this product and change project_id and deploy again, it will destroy previous deployment. 

### Stop EC2 when not used without worry
- When you start the EC2 (use shortcut "ec2") all your apps are started by default!

### How to find out unused cidr for new subnet
- Run this command in cmd. Make sure you replace VPC ID in the command with your VPC ID.
```bat
cd scripts
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File find-next-available-cidr.ps1 "vpc-your-vpc-id-here"
```

### Tip for setting your development environment
- Prefer to use AWS profile instead of directly using AWS credentials in enviroment variables
- Create a bat file on your desktop with this content:  
```bat
@echo off  
set AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=your-aws-profile  
start cmd /k "cd /d D:\Users\full-path-to-project-code && call scripts\start-dev.bat"  
```
- Whenever you want to start working on this project, just double click this bat file!  
- Read the info presented in the cmd window!  
- It offers following shortcuts:  
```ini
tfa = Terraform apply  
sshe = SSH into EC2  
ec2 = Start EC2  
ec2x = Stop EC2  
open-webui = Opens Open WebUI in Browser  
portainer = Opens Portainer in Browser  
code-server = Opens code-server in Browser  
litellm = Opens LiteLLM in Browser  
rkh = Remove known SSH host  
```

### How to allow my team members to use my Open WebUI server?
- Login to Open WebUI
- Click on top right avatar icon
- Settings -> Admin Settings -> General
- Turn on - Enable New Sign Ups
- Ensure that Default User Role is 'pending'
- If your team member is on other network, find out its public facing address, add it to the allowed_source_ips JSON array in terraform\terraform.tfvars.json file
- Do terraform apply
- Give them the URL of the Open WebUI
- Ask them to self sign
- Once they self sign, enable their access by:
    - Click on top right avatar icon
    - Click Admin Panel
    - Click PENDING once to make it USER
- Ask your user to login or refresh their page


### How to upgrade Open WebUI to new version
- SSH into EC2, and run:
```bash
cd docker/open-webui
docker-compose down
docker-compose down --rmi all
docker-compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

### I messed up the install. How can I restart?
- If you have done terraform apply...
    - In cmd window cd to terraform folder and do "terraform destroy"
    - Git clone in new folder, and follow instructions
- If yoh have not done terraform apply...
    - Git clone in new folder, and follow instructions
- See section: How to recreate EC2?

### When doing terraform apply: Error: No matching Internet Gateway found
- You should create Internet gatewat and attach to your VPC (see the instructions above)

### Using my browser, when I go to Portainer, I get the following error New Portainer installation Your Portainer instance timed out for security purposes. To re-enable your Portainer instance, you will need to restart Portainer.
- To resolve this, SSH into EC2 server
- Run this command
```bash
docker restart portainer
```
- Refresh browser
- Set password (min length 12 characters)


### When I ssh in EC2 I get error: The authenticity of host can't be established.
- From launcher run: rkh
- Then run: sshe


## Internal design/architecture

### Is this a good architecture?
- Yes and No!
- Do not use any design pattern used here in production systems.
- This is good desgn for quick and dirty setup for learning and experimentation.

### To avoid cost...
- We are not using Route53, API Gateay and ALBs
- All the work is done on single EC2
- Shortcuts are provided to start and stop EC2 easily

### How Caddy server is used?
- All the port numbers starting from 7100 are used by Caddy to serve apps running on ports from 8100 respectively. 
- Caddy config is stored at /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
- It uses a dummy cert to serve HTTPS
- Caddy can manage users and password and offer authentication. This is useful for appss that do not have native/local user management, like demo apps you may create etc.

### How server prodcuts are instaled on EC2?
- Server is setup using user-data script when creating EC2
- User data script is dynamically generated in terraform main.tf
- Files from docker etc folder are read by terraform and injected into user-data script along with ec2-setup/user-data.sh file. 
- See user-data.sh file to find how things are installed.
- Most of the products are run as Docker containers

### How Open WebUI is configured?
- For details look at these files:
    - docker\open-webui\docker-compose.yml
    - docker\open-webui\litellm-config.yml
- Open WebUI talks to LiteLLM and LiteLLM talks to Bedrock based on litellm-config.yml
- Open WebUI is using sqlite3 as the database
    - Location of sqlite3 db file: 


### How launcher works?
- Launcher is a bat file that you create on dektop so that you can work with this project.
- Launcher knows about the EC2, its IP address, etc.
- Launcher also offers you several shortcuts
- How do Launcher knows about this project?
    - When you do terraform apply, the script generates a bat file terraform\set-tf-output-2-env-var.bat
    - This bat file has information like Elastic IP, EC2 ID etc. 
    - The launcher read this file so it can use those information.
    - Shortcuts offered by Launcher is printed to the console when you launch it, so you not need to remember it!


## If you want to taint controller lambda, you have to taint url also
```bat
terraform taint aws_lambda_function.main_controller_lambda 
terraform taint aws_lambda_function_url.controller_lambda_url
```



### How to update and deploy Controller Lambda
- To deploy lambda (after you modify):
```bat
cd lambda
deploy controller
```
- If you add a package, ensure that you update erquirements.txt and run this form controller folder:
```bat
pip install -r requirements.txt -t package
```

### How to update Controller Lambda key?
- Open launcher, and run this commands:
```bat
set CONTROLLER_AUTH_KEY=<new-key>
cd lambda
deploy.bat controller
```
